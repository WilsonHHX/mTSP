# mTSP
Some implementation methods for mTSP
mTSP: multi-Agent Traveller salesmen problem

Hey, I'm Wilson Huang. This is my first project which use GitHub to store my code, and this project is begin in 2020/8/6.
My hope to create this project, first is to familiar with the GitHub so I can built the base of my road of coding life; second is to find something new in mTSP, maybe algorithm, maybe improvements to the algorithm. Anything is OK, I just want to use this proj to begin my research life.

this proj has no limit in what type of language you code, maybe C++, Python and Matlab is all OK.

if I can find somthing new, thank goodness!
